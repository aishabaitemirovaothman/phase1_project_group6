**Authors:** Aisha Baitemirova-Othman, Adonis McQueen, Angela Kim, Deja Prade, James Kang

## Overview

This project analyzes multiple movie datasets to come up with a business plan for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Business Problem & Key Questions

Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio but requires data-driven recommendations in order to decide what types of films to produce.

* *Which films in the past two decades have made the most profit?*
* *What are the genres of these films?*
* *Which films and genres are the most popular?*
* *Is there correlation between genre and profit?*
* *What is the relationship between genre and vote average?*

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio.
* The consistent trend of movies in the last decade have geared towards sci-fi, action, and adventure, or a combination of the three. Therefore, we recommend Microsoft focus on making movies like this because of the correlation between these three genres and profits.
* Any action/scifi/adventures movies made should be based upon Microsoft properties (Halo, Minecraft, etc). The highest grossing films are all established properties with large fanbases, and it is our recommendation that Microsoft follow suit with their own. This will ensure Microsoft isn't burdened with license and copyright fees for action content production.
* Drama and Comedy content are two other genres that should be considered. These genres dominate movie creation and also yield high profits. Animated comedy films typically have lower budgets, and the recent increase in cultural popularity of animated content encourages increased content creation. Drama films are consistently popular and have crossover appeal between genres (romance, adventure, scifi, etc) as well. Drama films can be based upon established properties or original creations.
