**Authors:** Aisha Baitemirova-Othman, Adonis McQueen, Angela Kim, Deja Prade, James Kang

## Overview

This project analyzes movie datasets from multiple databases to come up with a business plan for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Business Problem & Key Questions

Microsoft wants to break into the film industry but requires data-driven recommendations to ensure a profitable venture. Film production, especially with start-up costs, is expensive. The objective is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Heavy competition abounds in the film industry with the likes of behemoths such as Buena Vista and Universal Pictures. How can Microsoft secure success?

* *Which films in the past decade have made the most profit?*
* *What are the genres of these films?*
* *Which films and genres are the most popular?*
* *Is there correlation between genre and profit?*
* *What is the relationship between genre and vote average?*
* *Can Microsoft capitalize on its own franchises?*
* *What can we learn from other production studios?*
* *Would it cost-effective to acquire a smaller, already established studio?*

## Data Sources & Methods

Databases: IMDB, TheMovieDB, Box Office Mojo, the Numbers, and Rotten Tomatoes

Datasets: [data folder](https://github.com/aishabaitemirovaothman/phase1_project_group6/tree/main/data) in the repository
<br>
Methods: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Data Understanding & Analysis

Action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, comedy and animated movies are where the focus should be. While animated has the highest rating the other 5 categories have higher volumes of consumer interaction.

Over the last decade, domestic and worldwide film profits reveal general audiences gear toward familiarity, vastly preferring sequels and already established franchises over original content. They also show that the majority of the most profitable films of the last decade have been produced by Buena Vista and Universal Pictures.

67% of the top 30 films that made the highest domestic profits were produced by either Buena Vista or Universal Pictures, and when we take a look at worldwide profits, that market share is even higher at 73%.

Franchise films and the studios that produce them have the highest domestic gross. The third visual shows us that smaller studios (IFC, SPC, Wein), while creating a lot of content, do not yield the same gross. Therefore, we recommend that Microsoft focuses on content based on their own gaming properties to create content.

Studio acquisition is highly recommended, as the top content producers all operate under parent companies. Mini-major studios such as Relativity Media can be
acquired by Microsoft to boost content production.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio.
* The consistent trend of movies in the last decade have geared towards sci-fi, action, and adventure, or a combination of the three. Therefore, we recommend Microsoft focus on making movies like this because of the correlation between these three genres and profits.
* Any action/scifi/adventures movies made should be based upon Microsoft properties (Halo, Minecraft, etc). The highest grossing films are all established properties with large fanbases, and it is our recommendation that Microsoft follow suit with their own. This will ensure Microsoft isn't burdened with license and copyright fees for action content production.
* Drama and Comedy content are two other genres that should be considered. These genres dominate movie creation and also yield high profits. Animated comedy films typically have lower budgets, and the recent increase in cultural popularity of animated content encourages increased content creation. Drama films are consistently popular and have crossover appeal between genres (romance, adventure, scifi, etc) as well. Drama films can be based upon established properties or original creations.
